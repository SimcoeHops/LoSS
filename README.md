# LoSS - Lots of Stuff Summarizer ðŸ“œâœ¨

Welcome to **LoSS** (Lots of Stuff Summarizer)! 

## What Does This Script Do? ðŸ¤”

LoSS is a crude Python script designed to create and/or digest a wall of text, create a transcript, and send it to the OpenAI API using GPT 3.5 Turbo (by default, but feel free to change it to GPT4o if you've got deep pockets) in order to create an AI summary. Make sure you pip install requirements.txt, as this script depends on a few python libraries as well as ffmpeg and yt-dlp.
